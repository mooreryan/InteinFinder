## Code Coverage

Use `@@@coverage off/on` around types with `ppx` generated code.  E.g.,

```ocaml
[@@@coverage off]

type t = A | B [@@deriving sexp]

[@@@coverage on]
```

Use `[@coverage off]` around impossible cases.  Use it with `impossible` or `invalid_argf`.

```ocaml
let x = 1

if x > 0 then
  x
else
  Utils.impossible "x can't be negative here" [@coverage off]
```

### External software versions

The versions of mafft and ncbi blast are the same as on my local machine.  MMseqs is the same version, but with sse2 instead.

Keep them this way unless you change them locally, or you change the tests to not be so coupled to their specific output.

## Cram tests

If you have tests that depend on whitespace generated by linux utils  (e.g., when using `uniq -c` for counts.), you need to normalize it so the tests will pass on both linux and macOS.
